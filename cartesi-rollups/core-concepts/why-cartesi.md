Cartesi is an open-source project at the forefront of blockchain innovation.
The Cartesi Virtual Machine lies at the heart of our mission, representing a significant leap toward a modular blockchain future. 

With the Cartesi Virtual Machine, we are capable of rollups that can process 100x more than the EVM, using a Linux-based execution environment, which gives us access to tools and all the languages used by traditional software applications.

## Scalability

Cartesi is pioneering the implementation of application-specific rollups, offering a solution to the scalability issues that plague existing blockchain networks. 

Application-specific rollups act as off-chain execution layers that inherit security and censorship guarantees from the base layer. But now, instead of sharing space inside a single rollup, each dApp has its dedicated rollup to process off-chain computation. 

There are significantly lower costs for dApp development and operation. By providing dedicated computational resources for each dApp, Cartesi eliminates the competitive pressure for block space, resulting in more predictable and manageable costs for developers and users alike.

## Security and Decentralization
Cartesi's approach to rollups preserves the strong security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while offering a scalable and efficient execution environment. 

Application-specific rollups are designed with a 1-of-N security model, which means that the integrity of dApps is preserved even if only one honest validator is present. This ensures correct results on-chain without depending on the honesty of the majority.

## Programmability

Cartesi bridges the gap between blockchain and traditional software development by incorporating a full-fledged Linux operating system (OS) within its rollup solution. 

Think of building smart contracts by porting compilers, libraries, database systems, frameworks, and software stacks previously inconceivable on blockchain platforms.
